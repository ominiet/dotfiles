# Dotfiles
Personal dotfiles for Arch Linux config.

## General Structure
I've set up this repo so that it mimics the config files of
my $HOME directory so hopefully, copy pasting the contents
of this repo will work with minimal issues

### What's Included
This should be the working config files for the following:

* i3-gaps
[pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/x86_64/i3-gaps/)
* python-pywal
[pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/python-pywal/)
* compton
[pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacages/x86_64/compton/)
* backgrounds - small set of backgrounds that I just want to keep
* feh
[pacman](https://www.archlinux.org)

## Notes
* Most likely will add shell scripts to grab and place 
individual dotfiles to/from their normal places
